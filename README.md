## Introduction to GitHub

### Points To Remember - 
#### Branch -
A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. It is an essential feature available in most modern version control systems. A Git project can have more than one branch. We can perform many operations on Git branch-like rename, list, delete, etc.

#### Push -
The push term refers to upload local repository content to a remote repository. Pushing is an act of transfer commits from your local repository to a remote repository. Pushing is capable of overwriting changes; caution should be taken when pushing.

#### Pull/Pull Request -
The term Pull is used to receive data from GitHub. It fetches and merges changes on the remote server to your working directory. The git pull command is used to make a Git pull.

<b> Pull requests </b> are a process for a developer to notify team members that they have completed a feature. Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request via their remote server account. Pull request announces all the team members that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.

#### Fork
A fork is a rough copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely test and debug with changes without affecting the original project.

Great use of using forks to propose changes for bug fixes. To resolve an issue for a bug that you found, you can:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Make the fix.
3. Forward a pull request to the project owner.
